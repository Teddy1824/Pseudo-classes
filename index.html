        Forex is short for foreign exchange – the transaction of changing one
        currency into another currency. This process can be performed for a
        variety of reasons including commercial, tourism and to enable
        international trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        The foreign exchange (also known as forex or FX) market refers to the
        global marketplace where banks, institutions and investors trade and
        speculate on national currencies.

    <h1><u>What is the forex market?</u></h1>
    <fieldset>
      <p>
        The forex market is by far the largest and most liquid financial market
        in the world, with an estimated average global daily turnover of more
        than US$6.5 trillion — which has risen from $5 trillion just a few years
        ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        The forex market is open to buy and sell currencies 24 hours a day, five
        days a week and is used by banks, businesses, investment firms, hedge
        funds and retail traders.
      </p>
      <p>
        On critical feature of the forex market is that there is no central
        marketplace or exchange in a central location, as all trading is done
        electronically via computer networks. This is known as an
        over-the-counter (OTC) market.
